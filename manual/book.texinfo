@node Prologue
@unnumbered Prologue
I wanted to write a manual for the textgraph ecosystem. I thought it would be rather short. The file format is trivial and the utilities are only a few lines of code. But despite the simplicity of it all, I felt like I was describing the use of a hammer to an audience which had never seen a nail. In person, I would tell people about how the myopic graph editor lets you effectively edit and manipulate graph data and they would look at me quizzically and ask themselves? Why would I want to manipulate graph based data? Thus I find myself writing, not a manual, but a traveler's guide to the world of graphs.

@cindex graph

A graph is illustrated in @ref{graph}. When I use the word @emph{graph}, I am not referring to bar charts. In mathematics, @emph{graphs} are a kind of network. A graph is a collection of @emph{vertexes} which are connected by @emph{edges}. 

This is a book about graphs. I will discuss the myriad of ways that they can be, and have been, used to represent data, calculations, and systems. I will also discuss basic philosophical questions, such as "what is @emph{data}", "what is a @emph{calculation}" and "what is a @emph{system}?" Finally, I will discuss ways of manipulating digital representations of graphs using the textgraph ecosystem and I will present concrete examples of how you can use digital representations of graphs to enhance your understanding of the programs you write and improve automation and code reuse.

@node Natural Graph Based Systems
@chapter Natural Graph Based Systems
As the title of this manual suggests, I will start by presenting a history of graphs and graph based systems. 
There are three types of existence each with their own relationship to history. Abstract mathematical concepts exist without any relationship to time. The mathematical laws which govern graphs have always been and always will be. Physical graph-like structures came into existence some time after the big bang and we can discuss when they started appearing. Human formed theories about graphs, digital representations of graphs, and other "discoveries" are even simpler for the historian, because we often know exactly when these concepts were first published or used.

@section Non-biological Graph-like Structures

Interesting, natural non-biological, graph-like structures on the macro scale are rather rare. Matter tends to form clumps rather than strands and when strands do form they rarely connect. However, one of the most common uses of graphs in computer science is the representation of molecular structures.

@end float

Molecules are sort of graph like. But what looks clearly like @emph{vertexes} (atoms) and @emph{edges} (bonds) on paper is, in reality, an amorphous blob of amorphous electroniness with some nuclei stuck in the middle.

Looking to space as a model for non-biological physics, I see Mars covered with dust (not graph-like), rock (not graph-like), gases (not graph-like), lava (sometimes graph-like). There is so little graphiness on Mars, that it is hard to find anything that even looks like a tree (in the mathematical sense). However, these structures do exist. As I said earlier, matter likes to form clumps.

@end float

When you poor liquid around a bunch of clumps, the clumps become islands, which force the liquid to flow around them.

@end float

@cindex graphy

The liquid in question is now @emph{graphy}. It is an @url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#n-dimensional_torus, n-toroid}. Saying something is an n-toroid is a fancy way of saying that it has holes in it. But when I look at the water in @ref{LempisaariNaantaliFinland}, my brain does not immediately say "look! The water has holes in it!" My brain, rather, starts dissecting the water into @emph{channels}, and @emph{intersections between channels}. And when I really look at the picture cross eyed, I can even imagine that these intersections are @emph{vertices} and the channels are @emph{edges} of a graph. This is not quite true. An n-toroid is not a graph. The vertices and the edges are not distinct enough to really be a graph. But it's pretty graphy.

@cindex torus
@cindex toroid
@cindex n-torus
@cindex n-toroid

Just to make sure that everyone is up to speed, these are toroids:

@end float

A toroid really is any shape with a hole in it. A 1-toroid is any shape with one hole, a 2-toroid is any shape with two holes and an n-toroid is any shape with any number of holes.

This copper ore is pretty graphy too. It is formed by a liquid (molten copper) flowing around clumps of something else and then hardening. It is not a graph but it is an n-toroid and that's graphy.

@section Non-biological tree-like structures
@cindex tree-like

Tree-like structures can be interesting too and an n-toroid with tree like appendages is certainly more interesting than an n-toroid without them.

@caption{A toroid with tree-like appendages is more interesting than a toroid without (Copyright @copyright{} 2016 Timothy Hobbs CC-By-Sa 4.0)}
@end float

But since the tree-like-ness of a structure is not dependent on the existence of holes, we cannot determine if something is tree-like simply by asking if it is toroidal. I will not present a precise mathematical definition of what is tree-like, but you can certainly agree that a form which has narrowish appendages which branch is tree-like and is a lot more interesting than something that is merely blobly.

@end float

Tree-like structures and graphy structures are intimately related. One of the main ways that graphy toroidal structures are formed is when two tree-like structures are joined together. For example, the copper ore in @ref{copper} was a tree like mess of molten copper before it flowed around whatever it was flowing around to become toroidal and graphy. The corollary to this is when graphy toroidal structures are cut up. What were once loops become appendages, so tree-like structures can be formed when toroidal ones are damaged.

@section Formation Processes of Non-Biological Graphy and Tree-like Structures
@cindex gas expansion
@cindex ablation
@cindex growth

In the beginning of this chapter I presented the flow of a liquid around clumps as being the main formation process for graphy toroidal structures. I would like to present three more formation processes; @emph{gas expansion}, @emph{ablation} and @emph{growth}. @emph{Gas expansion} is when bubbles of gas form in a viscous liquid,  @emph{ablation} is when material is removed to create a toroidal or tree-like structure and @emph{growth} is a term that you already know.

@subsection Gas expansion

@float Figure,scoria
@image{./images/scoria,,200pt,Scoria,jpg}
@caption{Scoria, a type of porous rock formed by expanding bubbles of gas (Copyright @copyright{} 2008 @url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoria#/media/File:Scoria_Macro_Digon3.jpg, Jonathan Zander CC-By-Sa 3.0})}
@end float

The Scoria in @ref{scoria} is not actually as graphy as it might seem at first glance. It does have hollow bits, but it isn't particularly toroidal. As I said earlier, toroids have holes in them and these rocks tend to be water proof, not very holy. One type of porous rock, pumice, even floats on water because there is so much air trapped inside! When you think of the physical properties of expanding gas, it is clear why these rocks are rarely particularly toroidal. Gas expands, making bubbles. Those bubbles may then pop. But a popped bubble leaves a crater, not a hole going all the way through a material. Once a bubble has popped, there is no force of expanding gas which would cause another opening to appear on the other side of the crater. Thus, no real graphiness.

However, in concert with @emph{ablation}, porous rocks may become toroidal. After-all, the bubble walls are very thin and may be worn away quite easily.

@image{./images/lava-rock-ablated,,200pt,A graphy porous rock, the thin walls of which have become ablated.,jpg}
@caption{A graphy porous rock, the thin walls of which have become ablated. (Copyright @copyright{} 2015 @url{https://pixabay.com/en/stone-volcanic-rock-905093/,Ruben Rubio CC0 Public Domain})}
@end float

In rare cases, the popping of the bubbles is the direct cause of the graphiness and no ablation is needed.

@end float

@subsection Ablation

The toroidal graphy structures that we have seen so far, were all formed when a material was washed or blown away. Thus we have the superset of graphy structures which are formed by @emph{ablation}.

@enumerate
@item
A harder substance flowed and hardened around a softer substance which is then washed away.
@item
The thin walls of the bubbles in non-graphy porous rock are destroyed. (And generally, walls of uneven thickness being eroded, corroded, or weathered.)
@item
Uneven application of a corrosive substance.
@item
Wetting and drying cycles which change the hardness of parts of a rock by carrying some elements around.
@item
Complex eddy currents cause graphy erosion in a material which is otherwise uniform.
@end enumerate

Here are two examples of honeycomb weathering, a complex form of weathering in which calcium is moved around limestone by water, causing it to concentrate in a web like pattern forming a hardened web of rock.

@subsection Growth

Graph like structures can also @emph{grow}. Examples include stalactites, icicles, and crystals.

@section Biological Tree-like Structures

With the appearance of multi-celled life, the quantity and diversity of tree-like structures exploded.

@end float

Indeed, multi-celled life forms tend to have at least several tree-like appendages and it is rare for a life form to be truly bloby. This is completely different from the non-biological world, which is mostly bloby and rarely tree-like.

There must be something truly special about being tree-like, for life to have evolved to have such an unusual geometry. When I ask myself, why does life need to be so tree-like, my first impression is that it is hard to move if you're a blob. However, plants don't move, and they are even more treeish than animals are. Perhaps it is merely a side-effect of some property of growth. One of the few tree-like structures
